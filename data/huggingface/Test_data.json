The company posted a record-breaking revenue of $123.9 billion for the first quarter of 2022, up by 11% from the same period last year. The increase was fueled by stronger demand for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, as well as continued growth in its services segment. Apple's operating profit for the quarter came in at $38.3 billion, up 17% from a year earlier. The results surpassed analysts' expectations, who had anticipated revenue of around $118 billion. This strong performance is largely attributed to the successful launch of the iPhone 13, which has enjoyed robust sales since its debut in September. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement, \"Our record-breaking quarter reflects the strength of our entire ecosystem, from our innovative products and services to the unmatched dedication of our teams around the world.\" Despite the ongoing global supply chain disruptions, Apple has managed to maintain its growth trajectory, thanks in part to its vertically integrated operations and nimble supply chain management.

The policy includes the termination of accounts of anti-vaccine influencers. Tech giants have been criticised for not doing more to counter false health information on their sites. In July, US President Joe Biden said social media platforms were largely responsible for people's scepticism in getting vaccinated by spreading misinformation, and appealed for them to address the issue. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said 130,000 videos were removed from its platform since last year, when it implemented a ban on content spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines. In a blog post, the company said it had seen false claims about Covid jabs spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general. The new policy covers long-approved vaccines, such as those against measles or hepatitis B. We're expanding our medical misinformation policies on YouTube with new guidelines on currently administered vaccines that are approved and confirmed to be safe and effective by local health authorities and the WHO, the post said, referring to the World Health Organization.",

YouTube, which is owned by Google, said 130,000 videos were removed from its platform since last year, when it implemented a ban on content spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines. In a blog post, the company said it had seen false claims about Covid jabs spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general. The new policy covers long-approved vaccines, such as those against measles or hepatitis B.

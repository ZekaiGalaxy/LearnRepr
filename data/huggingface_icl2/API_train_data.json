The novel, set in the future year of 1984, tells the story of a man named Winston Smith. Winston lives in Airstrip One, which was once Great Britain, a province of the superstate Oceania. This totalitarian regime is led by the Party and its leader, Big Brother, who enforces total control over the population through omnipresent surveillance, psychological manipulation, and the suppression of free will.\n\nWinston works for the Ministry of Truth (Minitrue), an organization responsible for rewriting and altering historical records to fit the Party's propaganda. In his soul, Winston detests the Party and dreams of rebelling against Big Brother. His secret dissent begins when he starts writing his thoughts down in a diary, an act that would be punished by death if discovered.\n\nThroughout the novel, Winston becomes increasingly involved in acts of resistance against the Party. He embarks on a love affair with a woman named Julia and seeks out secret alliances with other rebels. He becomes obsessed with discovering the truth hidden behind the Party's lies, culminating in a desperate attempt to join the mysterious Brotherhood, a supposed secret society working against the Party.\n\nUltimately, Winston's rebellion is discovered by the Thought Police, who brutally torture and brainwash him. In the end, despite his initial defiance and disillusionment, Winston's will is shattered, and he comes to love Big Brother. The novel ends with a chilling portrayal of the total domination of the individual by the state and serves as a powerful warning of the dangers of unchecked government power and totalitarianism.",

Ortafin was a magical land, filled with creatures of every variety, from the tiniest sprites flitting between tree branches, to the giant, ancient beings who ruled over the land's waves and winds. In this mystical realm, the balance of power was carefully maintained by the four pillars of the world: the Solisar, Kournos, Valdum, and Saphira. Each of these powerful beings was a guardian of a sphere of influence, with Solisar commanding the skies above, Kournos ruling the earth below, Valdum controlling the vast seas, and the enigmatic Saphira overseeing the delicate balance of magic that pervaded everything. As the centuries passed and the world of Ortafin evolved, the influence of the guardians grew stronger, as did the complexity of their relationships. More creatures came into existence, new domains were discovered, and the guardians had to adapt their roles as Ortafin expanded ever further. Yet, in the heart of all of this was a struggle for power, a battle between the guardians.",

Many authors consider Anna Karenina the greatest work of literature ever and Tolstoy himself called it his first true novel. It was initially released in serial installments from 1873 to 1877 in the periodical The Russian Messenger. In Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy says that marriage is the root cause of all human conflicts. The novel explores different themes, including love, marriage, infidelity, hypocrisy, passion, and the role of women in society. The novel's two parallel plots center around Anna Karenina's doomed adulterous affair with Count Vronsky and the initially rocky marriage of Kitty and Levin, which eventually becomes a source of true happiness for them. The novel also deals with issues such as family, politics, and agricultural reform. One of the most memorable characters in the book is Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin who represents the quiet, idealistic country life. The book explores various dimensions of philosophical discussions on 'what it means to live a good life' along with reflections on Russia's societal norms in the late 19th century.\"",

Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli upset. I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset, said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day's play.You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things.

For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease.Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also, he said. But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI) ",

These vehicles have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, making our lives easier and our roads safer. One of the primary benefits of autonomous vehicles is their ability to reduce the number of accidents caused by human error. Statistics show that over 90% of accidents on the road are caused by human mistakes, such as distracted driving or driving under the influence. With the advanced technology in autonomous vehicles, these errors can be significantly reduced, if not completely eliminated. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed before we can fully embrace this technology. One such challenge is the issue of cybersecurity. As autonomous vehicles rely heavily on computer systems and internet connectivity, they can be vulnerable to cyberattacks. This poses a significant threat to both the passengers' safety and privacy. To mitigate these risks, manufacturers and software developers must work together to implement robust security measures in their systems. Additionally, the issue of liability in the event of an accident involving an autonomous vehicle must be addressed. Lawmakers and regulatory bodies need to develop clear guidelines for determining liability in these situations, ensuring a fair and balanced approach. Despite these challenges, the benefits of autonomous vehicles cannot be ignored. As the technology continues to improve, we can expect to see a safer and more efficient future for transportation.",

These miniature machines, each measuring just a few billionths of a meter in size, hold promise for applications in fields ranging from medicine to defense, and even environmental management. The scientists behind the discovery, led by Dr. X, employed cutting-edge techniques to construct the nanobots out of specialized materials, allowing them to be programmed for specific tasks and to collaborate with other nanobots to complete those tasks more efficiently. According to Dr. X, the key to the nanobots\u2019 success lies in their unique design, which draws inspiration from the natural world. By studying the way in which certain microscopic organisms are able to carry out complex tasks, the researchers were able to develop the technology necessary to replicate these abilities within the tiny machines. The wide range of potential applications for this technology is truly staggering, with experts suggesting that it could revolutionize the way we approach problems in fields as diverse as healthcare, where nanobots could be employed to target cancer cells, to the military, where they might be used to help detect and defuse hidden explosives. The Institute for Advanced Studies is now working in collaboration with several partners to test the feasibility of these exciting new systems and, in time, hopes to make them widely available for use in a whole host of applications.\"",

A breakthrough result from theoretical computer science, called the Shannon capacity theorem, states that there exists error-correcting codes capable of reliable data transmission with rates up to the so-called Shannon capacity. The main challenge is to design explicit and efficiently decodable codes that can achieve rates close to the Shannon capacity. Recently, deep learning models have shown promising results in various domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and game playing. In this paper, we address the question of whether deep learning models can achieve optimal error-correcting capabilities. We propose a framework based on recurrent neural networks for encoding and decoding error-correcting codes, called RNN-CODEC. The advantages of the proposed approach are its capacity to learn and adapt to different types of noise, and potential improvement in decoding performance over standard decoding algorithms.\"",

It is not good for cricket, I guess, he added.In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer however came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd.Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behaviour on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul.Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England's score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease.Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also, he said. But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI)",

NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June. The offer is a 3.5% premium to Samba\u2019s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions. The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf region\u2019s third-largest lender. The entity\u2019s $46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle East\u2019s biggest lender with about $268 billion of assets.",

Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli upset. I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset, said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day's play. You can say whatever you want to chant, but don't throw things at the fielders and all those things. It is not good for cricket, I guess, he added. In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer however came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd. Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behaviour on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul. Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated. Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test. At stumps, England's score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease.\"",
